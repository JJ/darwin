# Darwin Neuroevolution Framework

A framework intended to make Neuroevolution experiments easy, quick and fun. It
provides building blocks, samples and tooling to avoid the repetitive (and
potentially complex) scaffolding required to research new ideas.

The current implementation is a combination of portable C++ (running on Linux,
Windows and macOS), and a collection of Python scripts for post-processing
existing evolution traces.
